# ArduCAM Library Introduction
This is a opensource library for taking high resolution still images and short video clip on pico platforms using ArduCAM's camera moduels. <br>
The camera breakout boards should work with ArduCAM shield before connecting to the Pico boards. <br>
ArduCAM mini series camera modules like Mini-2MP, Mini-5MP(Plus) can be connected to Pico boards directly. <br>
In addition to Pico, the library can be ported to any hardware platforms as long as they have I2C and SPI interface based on this ArduCAM library. <br>
